# Mern-Sample app

In the first version we just have simple view that shows us the list of emails and a form for adding new email and passwords to the list.



## These are list of Tasks that would be done in each commit (in below order):

- Add update method to backend
- Selecting Items from list and update just password field
- Review and refactor backend code
- Adding material ui and using its style and UI elements for app
- Create custom hook for calling APIs according to a specific config
- Display Errors in Snackbars or toasts
- Review and refactor Front-end code.

these items would change after any commit. new items would be added here and the done items would have a overline.
bear with me while I'm developing this app.
